# Warframe Progression Tracker — Claude Working Notes

## Task List

Tasks are organized by priority. Update this list as work progresses.

### Current Baseline (Commit `7deeeb9` on 2026-03-26)

- [x] Profile import restores Mod Builder saved builds
- [x] Owned mods support per-mod maximum rank tracking
- [x] Progenitor weapons support valence bonus and optional valence-element optimization at rank 40
- [x] Optimizer goals include `Burst`, `Scaling`, `Crit`, and `Status` (legacy `damage` maps to `Burst`)
- [x] Prime Resurgence / Varzia availability is integrated into world state and prime availability flows
- [x] Mod Builder exports build JSON plus math/output snapshots for optimizer debugging

### Working Queue

### 🟡 High Impact (UX & Performance)

- [x] Add React error boundaries to every page (prevents full-page crashes when logic engines throw)
- [x] Add unit tests for the 16 logic engines — especially `requirementEngine`, `goalExpansion`, `processInvasions`
- [x] Fix WorldState 1-second timer (`useNow()`) to only re-render the active tab
- [x] Add confirmation step before profile import (currently merges immediately with no undo)
- [x] Add `useShallow` to heavy Zustand selectors in Goals and Requirements pages
- [x] Virtualize long lists: Inventory (already done), Mods (3000+ — mods + arcanes sections), Challenges (300 grid cards — acceptable without virtualization)
- [x] Complete light mode across all components (styles.css has comprehensive .theme-light remapping for all slate-* classes)
- [x] Extract duplicate profile import logic (`importProfileViewingDataJson` and `importProfileFromWarframeStatApi` are ~80% identical)
- [x] Add backup-before-migration to prevent data loss if schema migration fails

### 🟣 Explainability / UX

- [ ] Show optimizer assumptions clearly:
  - [ ] Target profile
  - [ ] Expected crit tier
  - [ ] Proc mix
  - [ ] Direct-hit contribution
  - [ ] DoT contribution
  - [ ] Armor / shield assumptions
- [ ] Add a “why this build won” panel
- [ ] Show proc-weight distribution more clearly

### 🟠 UX Polish

- [x] Fix invasion completion % to use runsCompleted / runsRequired instead of API-provided value
- [x] Add "almost complete" goal highlighting (e.g. highlight goals that are 90%+ done)
- [x] Link farming sources in Requirements page back to the Star Chart node
- [x] Add completion status overlay on Star Chart drop panels
- [x] Make Handbook more discoverable (consider surfacing on dashboard for new players)

### 🟢 Data / Infrastructure

- [x] Replace `src/data/All.json`, `wfdata.json`, `modsets.json`, `rivens.json`, `sources.json`, `moddescriptions.json` with imports from `external/warframe-items/raw/` and `external/warframe-drop-data/raw/`
- [x] Delete orphaned `src/data/` files with no TypeScript imports (patchlogs, variants, abilities, abilitystats, glyphs, modularparts)
- [x] Replace `_generated/wfcd-platinum.byPath.auto.json` with `marketCost` field from `All.json`
- [ ] Write generation scripts for remaining `_generated/` files (currently committed as stale artifacts):
  - [ ] `generateWfcdItems.ts` → `wfcd-items.byCatalogId.auto.json`
  - [ ] `generateWfcdAcquisition.ts` → `wfcd-acquisition.byCatalogId.auto.json`
  - [ ] `generateWfcdRequirements.ts` → `wfcd-requirements.byCatalogId.auto.json`
  - [ ] `generateSourceLabelMap.ts` → `wfcd-source-label-map.auto.json` / `source-label-map.auto.json`
  - [ ] `generateRelicMissionIndex.ts` → `relic-missionRewards-index.auto.json`
- [ ] Run generation scripts to regenerate all `_generated/` files from external sources
- [ ] Add npm script (e.g. `generate:data`) to run all generation scripts in order

### 🔵 New Features (Roadmap)

- [x] Relic farming assistant (void fissure tier optimizer, void trace calculator)
- [x] Mod ownership tracking (prerequisite for loadout planning)
- [x] Vaulted/unvaulted item status integration
- [ ] Nightwave challenge optimizer ("which weeklies give max creds fastest?")
- [ ] Steel Path rotation calendar (when does my target item return?)
- [ ] Full set-mod bonus implementation
- [ ] Full Galvanized conditional/proc-stack verification
- [ ] Full arcane optimization verification

## Working Conventions

- Run `tsc -b` before committing to catch type errors
- Logic engines in `src/domain/logic/` are pure functions — keep them that way
- Canonical IDs live in `src/domain/ids/` — use enums, never raw strings
- State mutations go through Zustand + Immer in `src/store/store.ts`
- New acquisition sources belong in `src/catalog/` as a new adapter file
